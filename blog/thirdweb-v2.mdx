We're excited to announce a major upgrade to the thirdweb platform! We've been hard at work to improve the thirdweb experience on all fronts: dashboard, contracts, and SDK. 

## TLDR

- New Contracts architecture → up to 10x gas savings!
- Revamped Dashboard → Better UX
- Refreshed SDKs → Better DX
- thirdweb is now completely free to use (you just pay gas) 

## How to try it out

- Try out the new dashboard: [https://thirdweb.com/dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard)
- Install the latest SDK: `npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk`

## Revamped Dashboard

We've simplified the thirdweb dashboard by removing Projects, and renaming Modules to Contracts. You can now deploy contracts directly from your wallet, saving you time and gas.

We've reworked our UI, polished our user flows, and made it more performant.

Give it a try at [https://thirdweb.com/dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard)

## Brand New Contract Architecture

We've rethought our contract architecture from the ground up. The new architecture enables massive gas savings when deploying new contracts, with each contract still 100% owned by you.

By leveraging proxy contracts and removing the project deployment requirement, **thirdweb is now up 10x cheaper to deploy new contracts**.

This is a huge step towards lowering the barrier to entry for web3 developers even further.

Stay tuned for an in-depth article from our contract engineering team on this new architecture.

## Brand New Typescript SDK

Our popular Typescript SDK just got even better! We've given it a fresh coat of paint, improved the developer experience, and added quality of life API changes.

You can play with it right now by installing the latest version:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk
```

Deploying, configuring, and interacting with your smart contracts from your own code is now more consistent and predictable across the entire SDK.

```javascript
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("your_rpc_url_or_signer");

// access your deployed contracts
const nftDrop = sdk.getNFTDrop("0x...");
const marketplace = sdk.getMarketplace("0x...");

// Read from your contract
const listings = await marketplace.getAllListings();

// Perform transactions (requires a signer)
await nftDrop.claim(quantity);
```

Check out the new code snippets from the Dashboard directly to get familiar with the new APIs. Each deployed contract has a "Code" tab to show you how to interact with it from code.

Expect new articles, guides and code snippets in the coming days to cover everything that's changed, as well as improved Python and Go SDKs. In the meantime check out the latest releases on [Github](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/typescript-sdk/tree/v2).

## thirdweb is now completely free to use (you just pay gas) 

We’ve reworked our business model to completely remove any friction for developers, creators and brands looking to build web3 apps and experiences. 

Our core product will always be free to use. 

This means you keep 100% of the money you make launching NFTs, marketplaces, tokens, governance contracts and more forever. 

In the future, we will introduce advanced features which you can decide to pay for. We’ll always be clear and transparent with how much these features cost. 

## We're just getting started!

There's much more to come on dashboard, contracts, and SDK. Your feedback is precious to us, join us on [Discord](http://discord.gg/thirdweb) and tell us what you think!
